# Internal Tools Access

Developers working on the Veteran-facing Services Platform have access to Internal Tools that allow them to:

* Build logs and details from Jenkins (linked to from GitHub PRs for each project)
* System metrics for diagnostic/troubleshooting purposes (Grafana/Prometheus)
* Exception reports and tracebacks (Sentry)
