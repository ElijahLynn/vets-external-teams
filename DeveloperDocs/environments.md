# Environments

Vets-API and Vets-Website are automatically deployed to three shared environments. Additionally, the latest changes on all Pull Requests are automatically deployed to a [Review Instance](development-workflow.md/#review-instances). Each of these deployments is connected with External Services within the VA to facilitate testing.

| Environment | Vets-API | Vets-Website |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ |
| development | dev-api.va.gov | dev.va.gov |
| staging | staging-api.va.gov | staging.va.gov |
| production | api.va.gov | www.va.gov |
