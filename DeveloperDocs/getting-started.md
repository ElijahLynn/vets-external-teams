# Getting Started


To build a service on the Veteran-facing Services Platform, which can be anything from a digital form to a map-based facility locator, developers will create a Frontend experience in React on Vets-Website, and connect it to an Integration on Vets-API, which manages the data flow to and from VA systems.

## Development

#### Code repositories

The Veteran-facing Services Platform is broken into three parts:

1. [Vets-Website](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website), which contains frontend applications and components users interact with

1. [Vets-API](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api), a JSON-based API used by the frontend to provide data to and from VA systems

1. [Vets-JSON-Schema](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema), which contains shared resources used to structure and validate form data between Vets-Website and Vets-API.


#### Internal Tools

To get access to metrics, build logs, deployment information and exception details, see [Internal Tools Access](internal-tools-access.md) documentation.
