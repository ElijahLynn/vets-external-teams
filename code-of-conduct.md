# Veteran-facing Services Platform Code of Conduct

## Background

This document isn't all encompassing, nor does it supersede any laws. It's designed to explicitly state what we all should already know to be true.

## Code of Conduct

The Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) team believes in creating inclusive, friendly, and welcoming environments for all&mdash;free from discrimination for any reason.

The VSP team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free work experience for everyone. Harassment includes statements or actions related to gender identity (including history and expression), age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or other protected status that we reasonably determine offend, demean, intimidate, or harm another person, whether those statements occur in public or in private.

Examples of conduct that may violate this code include the following: the use of sexual language or imagery; unwanted sexual attention; failure to maintain reasonable personal space boundaries; refusing to end conversation when requested; unauthorized access to computer equipment, including keylogging, screenshotting, or tampering.

## What to do if an incident arises

If you notice or experience a violation of this Code of Conduct, either toward yourself or someone else, immediately alert your supervisor. If an event occurs that you believe violates the law or jeopardizes your safety, call 911.
