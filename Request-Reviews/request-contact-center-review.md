## Prepare for Contact Center Review

### Step 1: Create the Product Guide

* <a href="../Templates/sample-product-guide-1.pdf" target="_blank">Example Product Guide 1</a>
* <a href="../Templates/sample-product-guide-2.pdf" target="_blank">Example Product Guide 2</a>

*If you're building a brand new service*:

  1. Create a Product Guide that covers all the functionality, the main user flow(s), any error conditions, and how the user can resolve those errors.
  1. The Product Guide must be a Word document or a PDF.
  1. Create a new folder in your team's Product folder called ```Contact Center.``` Store the Product Guide there.

*If you're building new features for an existing service*:

  1. You'll need to update the existing Product Guide.
      * If you can't find the existing Product Guide on Github, ask your DSVA Contact to find it for you.
  1. Store the updated Product Guide in its original location.


### Step 2: Create the Product Video

*For new services and updates to existing services*:

  1. Create a Product Video (with audio) that steps through the primary user flows.
  1. Review your Product Video with your DSVA Contact to make sure you've covered everything.
  1. Create a transcript of the audio from the Product Video. The transcript must be a Word document or a PDF.
  1. Request that your Product Video be added to the official VA YouTube channel.
      * Your Product Video will be unlisted but visible to people with the URL.
      * [Follow the instructions here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Work%20Practices/Product%20Management/Demo%20Video%20Creation%20Process.md#4-request-that-the-video-be-posted-on-the-va-youtube-channel) to request the Product Video be added to the official VA YouTube channel.
  1. Once you receive the email saying your video has been added, continue to [Request Contact Center Review](#request-contact-center-review).
