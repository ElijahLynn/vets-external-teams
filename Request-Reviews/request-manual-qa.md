### Request a Manual QA

1. File an issue in ```vets-team repo```.
    * Title: ```Request Manual QA```
    * Labels: 
      * ```qa```
      * ```external-request```
      * ```[your team's Github label]```, e.g., "BAH-526"
    * Assign the issue to: ```[your DSVA contact]```
    * Comment: 
      * **Context:** Provide a high-level description of the functionality for which you're requesting this review,
        * e.g., ```Functionality adds a new dataset to the Facility Locator so users can search for and view non-VA health providers on the map, as well as in list and detail views.```
      * **URL:** ```link to your project on staging```
      * TODO - provide an example here.
1. **Within 4 business days**, DSVA will conduct a Content QA using the [Checklist below](#content-qa-checklist).
    * If you don't hear anything after 4 business days, reach out to your DSVA Contact.
1. DSVA will update the Github issue with a Word document (with changes tracked) to show where content needs to be changed.
1. Complete all the changes requested in the Word document.
    * If your team has questions (or disagrees with a requested change), use the Github issue to discuss that with DSVA.
1. When all changes are completed, close the issue.
1. After you've closed the issue, this pre-launch activity is considered complete.
