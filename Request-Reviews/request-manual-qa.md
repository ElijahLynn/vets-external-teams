### Request Manual QA

1. File an issue in ```vets-team repo```.
    * Title: ```Request Manual QA```
    * Labels: 
      * ```qa```
      * ```external-request```
      * ```[your team's Github label]```, e.g., "BAH-526"
    * Assign the issue to: ```[your DSVA contact]```
    * Comment: 
      * **Context:** Provide a high-level description of the functionality for which you're requesting this review,
        * e.g., ```Functionality adds a new dataset to the Facility Locator so users can search for and view non-VA health providers on the map, as well as in list and detail views.```
      * **URL:** ```link to your project on staging```
      * TODO - provide an example here.
1. **Within 4 business days**, DSVA will conduct manual QA using information provided in the [Checklist below](#Manual-qa-checklist).
    * If you don't hear anything after 4 business days, reach out to your DSVA Contact.
1. DSVA will update the Github issue with requirements expected to be met before release and should include a testing matrix.
1. Complete all test cases in the testing matrix, logging each defect in Github, referencing the epic.
    * If your team has questions about application requirements, use the Github issue to discuss that with DSVA.
1. When each defect is verified, mark it as such in its Github ticket and close it.
